                Dan Scheneider is a holloywood director with a notorious foot 
                fetish and pedophilia allegations against him. This has earned 
                him a long list of vile and inappropriate nicknames. We have 
                created a webste where people can compile and create a repository 
                of Dan Schneider nicknames for their own amusement. Enjoy!
